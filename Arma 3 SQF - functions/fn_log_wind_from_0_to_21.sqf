 * REQUIRES ACE3

 * Author: P1ker / Ari Hietanen
 * 
 * Logs the wind values at player's position from 0 meters Above Terrain Level
 * to 21m ATL (+ you can see the wind ) with increments of 0.1 
 * in the format "Altitude<NUMBER>;Ratio<NUMBER>"
 * 
 * From the ratio you can see the full wind speed can be measured at 20 ATL and above
 * unless there's an obstacle (such as a hill or building) blocking the measurement
 * 
 * Return Value:
 * Nil
 *
 * Example:
 * execVM "fn_log_wind_from_0_to_20.sqf";
 * ^ Requires the .sqf to be in the mission folder
